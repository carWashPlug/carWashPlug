# Car Wash Plug

## Event Driven Applications
### Requirements

Your application must employ the following programming concepts:
1. A “hub” server that moderates all events
2. Multiple “clients” that connect to the hub which can both publish and subscribe to events
3. Must operate over a network

### Optional:

- Engage an API that uses a database to store/retrieve information based on the events being triggered
- Employ a standard “Queue” to ensure all messages are properly delivered
- Employ a FIFO “Queue” to ensure ordered delivery of some events
